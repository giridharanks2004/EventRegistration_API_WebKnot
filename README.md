My learnings about entitiy relationship mapping was used to the fullest to map Student with College and Student with registrations and also created an attendance controller that can access event and student entitiy that was something chalenging but was testing my ablity and let me go beyond normal crud i did a non stop code crunch to achieve this feat and more details about my project are added in the report which i feel is clearer and i used chatgpt to give me a walkthourgh and help me through sorting errors, gpt was assisting in errors and uncharted terittory while i took over the hands on coding, it was great felt like serving an actual business purpose with logic 
excited to build more apis 
with the given time and the given requirements i have achived a cleaner and working api and done manual teting instead of junit due to time constraint and i would improve the api furthuer by rolebased access and jwt authorisation and authentication and integrate to a front end by JS fetch promises
